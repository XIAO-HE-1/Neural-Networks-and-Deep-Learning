# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
## Introduction
This repo contains deep learning projects for [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). These projects cover different aspects of nerual networks and deep learning, including theories (CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, optimization, Residual Networks, and more) and applications (face recognition, neural style transfer, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, translation, speech recognition and natural language processing).
